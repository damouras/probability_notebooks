    "## Conditional Probability \n",
    "\n",
    "Conditioning updates probabilities by incorporating (partial) information in the form of conditioning events. The conditioning operation is crucial for virtually every application of probability theory, but this notebook will focus on [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) and, more specifically, [Channel Coding (a.k.a. Error Detection and Correction)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction). This is the study of *codes* for communicating over noisy channels, and has applications anywhere from WiFi to computer memory devices. Interestingly, the performance, and hence design, of such codes relies crucialy on probability theory."

    "####  Binary Symmetric Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the basic channel coding setup: Alice wants to transmit a \"message\" to Bob over over a *binary* channel (e.g. wire with on=1/off=0 states). The message could be anything (e.g. a number, word, or image), but it has to be *encoded* into a binary string for sending over the channel. Similarly, Bob has to *decode* the binary string he receives to convert it back to the original message. The convention for encodind and decoding is called the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code).\n",

Esham, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_symmetric_channel_(en).svg\"><img width=\"512\" alt=\"Binary symmetric channel (en)\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Binary_symmetric_channel_%28en%29.svg/512px-Binary_symmetric_channel_%28en%29.svg.png\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the communication channel was perfect, the choice of code would be straightforward: we would use the most succinct (i.e. shortest) mapping of messages to binary strings. But the channel is \"noisy\" and can randomly change states with equal probability $p$ of switching from 0 to 1, and vice-versa; this classical setup is called the [binary symmetric channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_symmetric_channel).

    "#### Binary Representation Code\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix ideas, assume the message is a digit in 0-9, and that all digits are equally likely. In other words, without receiving *any* message (no information) Bob would expect a digit in 0-9 with equal probability. Each message is then *encoded* into a binary sequence of 0's and 1' according to *some* encoding function $E()$. The coded message is then transmitted over the channel, and Bob receives a (possibly corrupted) signal, which is then *decoded* into a message or an error ($err$), according to the decoding function $D()$. There are different ways to treat errors, depending on whether the channel allows for two-way communication (e.g. Bob can request a repeat if he gets an error), but to keep things simple we assume only one-way communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix ideas, let our coding scheme map the 10 messages/digits, denoted $M_i,\\; i=0,\\ldots,9$  onto their classical binary representation, i.e. $E(0)=(0000)$, $E(1)=(0001)$, up to $E(9)=(1001)$. We use strings of length 4 because we need at least $\\log_2(10) = 3.3219$ bits to represent 10 numbers. This leaves us with $2^4-10=6$ unused strings, which the decoder maps to an error; the entire coding scheme is represented below:\n",

    "##### Conditional Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two sources of randomnes, represented in red:\n",
    "1. the choice of message (from the perspective of Bob, who doesn't know Alice's intentions), and \n",
    "2. the noisy transmission. \n",
    "\n",
    "The encoding and decoding are deterministic 1-to-1 functions (black arrows). Without information (i.e. received code), Bob knows that every message (digit) is equally likely to be chosen by Alice. Let's represent this by assigning events $M_0,\\ldots,M_9$ for each digit, where $P(M_i)=.1, \\;  i=0,\\ldots,9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Bob obtains information in the form of the received code $R_j$, he updates the message probabilities accordingly. He is now interested in $P(M_i|R_j)$, but this probability is not directly available. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we know $P(R_j|M_i)$ from the binary symmetric channel assumption, since the probability of any error (flipped bit) is $p$, independently of other errors. For example, for message $M_1=\\{1\\}$ with $E(M_1)=(0001)$ the probability of receiving code $(0100)$ ($R_4$) is $p^2 \\times (1-p)^{4-2}$, because the codes differ by 2 bits, so there were 2 errors and 4-2=2 correct bits (their location is irrelevant). More generally, we have: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(R_j | M_i ) = p^{ d_{ham} ( E(M_i), R_j )  } \\times (1-p)^{ 4 - d_{ham} ( E(M_i), R_j ) } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d_{ham}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance), i.e. the number of differring characters in two strings of the same length. Assuming the transmission error probability is $p=5\\%$, we can calculate *all* conditional probabilities of the form $P( R_j | M_i ),\\; j=0,\\ldots,9, \\; i = 0,\\ldots, 15$ in the $10 \\times 16$ matrix ```P_RgM```, where the row index represents the message, and the column index the received code.

For example, let's change the coding scheme so that $9$ maps to $(1111)$, which is farther apart from the other codes in Hamming distance, and hence less likely to get mixed up. The joint probability matrix for this scheme is shown below (note the change in the last row's code):\n",

    "For fixed code length, there will be trade-offs between correct transmission, detected/corrected, and silent errors. But there is a way to improve *all* metrics by introducing [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(information_theory)), i.e. transmitting more bits that the absolutely minimum necessary. Essentially, this \"expands\" the space of possible codes so that you can map messages farther apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "But redundancy introduces also concerns of *efficiency*: for example, you could transmit a digit with miniscule probability of error using a 1000-bit code, but that would use up too much time and resources for transmitting 1000 instead of 4 bits. There is actually a celebrated [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem) that provides the optimal trade-off between the accuracy and redundancy (code length) of a channel, unfortunately without identifying the optimal code that achieves it; ironically, the theorem's proof uses *random* codes! In fact, even for \"simple\" setups such as the above, finding the optimal code is an [open problem](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4416045/how-to-find-the-maximal-minimal-distance-between-m-points-in-a-k-dimension-hammi).\n"

    "1. Assume the original setup above, i.e a binary symmetric channel ($p=.05\\%$) with binary representation for the 10 digits. To minimize errors, you decide to transmit every bit in the binary representation *3 times*, and take the majority bit as received; this is an example of a [repetition code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code). E.g., $2$ would be mapped to $(0010)$, which would be transmitted as $((000)(000)(111)(000))$. At the other end, if Bob received $( (010) (\\cdots)(\\cdots)(\\cdots) )$, he would automatically correct $(010)$ to $0$, since 2/3 bits are $0$, etc. Find the probability of correct transmission for this scheme; this is a simple enough analytical caclulation that does not require Python. <br>\n",
