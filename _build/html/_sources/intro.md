# Probability Notebooks

Welcome to my collection of probability theory applications illustrated through [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. 
These notebooks contain examples of practical applications implemented in Python. They are categorized by topic, and they contain practice problems at the end of each notebook (with solutions in a separate notebook).
You can find the code (.ipynb file) for each notebook on [github](https://github.com/damouras/probability_notebooks).
